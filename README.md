# EE_595_Final_Project
# Project Title
Machine Learning–Based Predictive Analysis

## Overview
This project implements a complete machine learning workflow to analyze a real-world dataset and build predictive models for the target variable. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results using Python and popular data science libraries.

The goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques in a structured and reproducible manner while emphasizing both predictive performance and interpretability.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains structured tabular data with both numerical and categorical features.
- Preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling where necessary.
- Exploratory analysis reveals meaningful relationships between predictors and the target variable, guiding model selection.

> Note: The dataset is either publicly available.

## Methodology
The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline:

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Importing the dataset
   - Handling missing or inconsistent values
   - Ensuring correct data types

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution analysis of features and target
   - Correlation analysis
   - Visualization to identify trends and patterns

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Scaling numerical features
   - Feature selection (if applicable)

4. **Model Training**
   - Train–test split
   - Baseline and advanced machine learning models
   - Model fitting using scikit-learn

5. **Evaluation**
   - Performance metrics such as R², RMSE, accuracy, or similar (depending on the task)
   - Comparison of model performance
   - Interpretation of results

6. **Conclusion**
   - Key findings
   - Model limitations
   - Potential improvements and future work
